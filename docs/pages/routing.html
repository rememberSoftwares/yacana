					<h2>Concepts of routing</h2>
					<p>Other frameworks tend to make abstractions for everything. Even things that don't need any.
						That's why I'll show you how to do routing with only what we have seen earlier. Yacana doesn't
						provide routing abstraction because there is no need to do so. </p>
					<p>But what is routing? Well, having LLMs solve a Task and then chaining many others in a sequence
						is good but to be efficient you have to create conditional workflows. In particular when using
						local LLMs that don't have the power to solve all Tasks with only one prompt. You must create an
						AI workflow in advance that will go forward step by step and converge to some expected result.
						AI allows you to deal with some level of unknown but you can't expect having a master brain
						(like in crewAI) that distributes tasks to agents and achieves an expected result. It's
						IMPOSSIBLE with local LLMs. They are too dumb! Therefore they need you to help them along their
						path. This is why LangGraph works well with local LLMs and Yacana does too. You create a
						workflow and when conditions are met you switch from one branch to another that treats more
						specific cases, etc. </p>
					<hr />
					<p>The most common routing mechanic is "yes" / "no". Depending on the result, your program can do
						different things next. Let's see an example: </p>
					<pre><code class="language-python">from yacana import Agent, Task

agent1 = Agent("AI assistant", "llama3:8b", system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant")

# Let's invent a question about 'plants'
question: str = "Why do leaves fall in autumn ?"

# Ask if the question is plant related: yes or no
router_answer: str = Task(f"Is the following question about plants ? <question>{question}</question> Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'.", agent1).solve().content

if "yes" in router_answer.lower():
    print("Yes, question is about plants")
    # next step in the workflow that involves plants

elif "no" in router_answer.lower():
    print("No, question is NOT about plants")
    # Next step in the workflow that DOESN'T involve plants
</code></pre><br>
					<p>You should get the following output:</p>
					<pre><code class="text-output">INFO: [PROMPT]: Is the following question about plants? <question>Why do leaves fall in autumn ?</question> Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: yes
Question is about plants
</code></pre><br>
					<p>▶️ Many things are happening here. We didn't implement an abstraction to simplify things but the
						downside is that you must learn a few tricks: </p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Always compare with lower case string</strong>: Because LLMs have their own mind
							they do not always answer a straight <code>yes</code>. Sometimes you get "Yes" or even full
							cap "YES" for no reason. </li>
						<li><strong>Always start by searching for "yes"</strong>: We do a substring match using the
							<code>in</code> keyword of Python because the LLM doesn't always respect the instructions of
							outputting <code>ONLY 'yes' or 'no'</code>. Sometimes you'll get <i>"yes!"</i> or <i>"Great idea, I say yes"</i>.
							Substring match will match <i>"yes"</i> anywhere in the LLM answer.<br>
							But what if you looked for <i>"no"</i>
							first and the LLM generated <i>"Not sure but I would say yes"</i>. Because we search for substrings
							the condition would match the <i>"no"</i> part of the word <i>"Not"</i> even though the LLM said <i>yes</i>. We
							could use regexe to fix this but it's easier to just start the condition by looking for
							<i>"yes"</i> as there are no English words that contain <i>"yes"</i> in a substring (at least no common
							ones ^^).</li>
						<li><strong>Force the LLM to respect the instruction</strong>: Tell it to <code>answer ONLY with
							'xx'</code>. See the use of the upper cap on <i>"ONLY"</i>? Also, the single quotes around the possible
							choices <code>'yes'</code> and <code>'no'</code> help the LLM that sees them as delimiters. </li>
						<li><strong>Use formatting tags</strong>: The question that is mentioned in the prompt is then
							given in custom <code>&#60;question&#62;</code> tags. LLMs love delimiters. This way the LLM knows
							when the question starts and when the question ends. This technique helps to differentiate
							your prompt and the dynamic part. You don't have to add tags everywhere but they can prove
							useful. Do not abuse them or the LLM might start using them in its response. Just keep this
							trick in mind. </li>
					</ol>
					<p class="icon solid fa-info-circle"> This is all basic prompt engineering. If you wish to build an app with local models you will
						definitely have to learn those tricks. LLMs are unpredictable. It's why we built them. </p>

						<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Self-reflection routing</h2>
					<p>As local models are a bit dumb you need to let them think on their own before making a decision.
						This is called self-reflection. It will cost one more Task to solve but you'll get significantly
						better results during routing, in particular when routing on more complex things (other than
						"yes"|"no").</p>
					<p>Let's update the routing section of our code to look like this: </p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"># Asking for a reasoning step
Task(f"Is the following question about plants ? <question>{question}</question>\nExplain your reasoning.", agent1).solve()

# Basic yes/no routing based on the previous reasoning
router_answer: str = Task(f"To summarize in one word, was the question about plants ? Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'.", agent1).solve().content
</code></pre><br>
					<p>We added one more Task that executes BEFORE the router. </p>
					<p>You should get this type of output:</p>
					<pre><code class="text-output">INFO: [PROMPT]: Is the following question about plants ? <question>Why do leaves fall in autumn ?</question>
Explain your reasoning

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: A great question!

Yes, I believe this question is indeed about plants. Specifically, it's related to the fascinating process of leaf senescence and abscission that occurs during autumn (or fall) in many plant species.

Here's why:

1. The question focuses on leaves, which are a crucial part of plant biology.
2. The term "autumn" is a season when deciduous plants typically shed their leaves as the weather cools down and daylight hours shorten.
3. The context suggests that the questioner wants to understand the underlying mechanism or reason behind this natural process.

Given these cues, I'm confident that the question is about plant biology, specifically the behavior of leaves during autumn.

INFO: [PROMPT]: To summarize in one word, was the question about plants ? Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: Yes
Question is about plants
</code></pre><br>
					<p>See how the LLM had an "intense" reflection on the subject. This is very good. You want LLMs to
						do reasoning like this. It will improve the overall result for the next Tasks to solve. </p>
					<p>▶️The prompt engineering techniques used here are:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Make it think</strong>: Using the expression "Explain your reasoning." makes it
							generate a logical answer. Note that if the model is bad at reasoning or makes a mistake
							during this step it may result in extremely bad situations. But fear not, failsafes can be
							built to limit bad reasoning. For instance, having another LLM check the logic and interact
							with the original Agent (see GroupSolve later on) to show it its mistake. You could also
							give tools to the Agent that will help it achieve the truth and not rely solely on his
							reasoning abilities (see Tools later on). </li>
						<li><strong>Making it two shots</strong>: Now that we have 2 Tasks instead of one, the second
							one only focuses on one task: "yes" or "no" interpretation of the result of Task1. Cutting
							objectives in multiple sub-tasks gives better performance. This why using an agentic
							framework is great but it's also why it's consuming a lot of tokens and having "free to run"
							local LLMs is great! </li>
					</ol>
					<p>Full code:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python">from yacana import Agent, Task

agent1 = Agent("AI assistant", "llama3:8b", system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant")

# Let's invent a question about 'plants'

# Asking for a reasoning step

    print("No, question is NOT about plants")
    # Next step in the workflow that DOESN'T involve plants
</code></pre><br>

<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Cleaning history</h2>
					<p>Keeping the self-reflection prompt and the associated answer is always good. It helps
						guardrailing the LLM. But the "yes"/"no" router on the other hand adds unnecessary noise to the
						Agent's history. Moreover, local models don't have huge context window sizes, so removing
						useless interactions is always good. <br />
						The "yes"/"no" router is only useful once. Then we should make the Agent forget it ever happened
						after it answered. No need to keep that… This is why the Task class offers an optional
						parameter: <code>forget=&#60;bool&#62;</code>. </p>
					<p>Update the router line with this new parameter:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python">
router_answer: str = Task(f"To summarize in one word, was the question about plants ? Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'.", agent1, forget=True).solve().content
					</code></pre><br>
					<p>Now, even though you cannot see it, the Agent doesn't remember solving this Task. In the next
						section, we'll see how to access and manipulate the history. Then, you'll be able to see what
						the Agent remembers! </p>

						<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Routing demonstration</h2>
					<p>For this demo, we'll make an app that takes a user query (HF replacing the static string by a
						Python <code>input()</code> if you wish) that checks if the query is about plants. <br />
						If it is not we end the workflow there. However, if it is about plants the flow will branch and
						search if a plant type/name was given. If it was then it is extracted and knowledge about the
						plant will be shown before answering the original question. If not it will simply answer the
						query as is. </p>

					<pre><code class="text-output">INFO: [PROMPT]: Is the following question about plants ? <question>Why do leaves fall in autumn ?</question>
Explain your reasoning.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: A great question!

Yes, I believe this question is indeed about plants! Here's why:

* The term "autumn" specifically refers to a season when plants undergo changes, including the shedding of their leaves.
* Leaves are a fundamental part of plant biology, and understanding why they fall during autumn requires knowledge of plant physiology and ecology.

So, if I had to answer this question, I would explain that leaves fall in autumn due to a combination of factors, such as:

1. Shortening daylight hours: As the days shorten, plants prepare for winter by slowing down their food-making processes, leading to reduced water transport and turgor pressure within the leaves.
[BLABLA]
4. Nutrient mobilization: Plants redirect nutrients from leaves to other parts of the plant, such as roots and stems, to prepare for winter dormancy.

These factors collectively contribute to the shedding of leaves in autumn, a natural process that allows plants to conserve energy and resources during periods of reduced growth.

INFO: [PROMPT]: To summarize in one word, was the question about plants ? Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: Yes
Question is about plants !

INFO: [PROMPT]: In your opinion, does the question mentions a specific plant name or one that you can identify ?

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: Upon re-reading the question, I realize that it doesn't mention a specific plant name. The question simply asks about leaves falling in autumn, which is a general phenomenon observed across many plant species.

So, my answer would be no, the question does not specifically mention a particular plant name or one that can be identified as unique to a certain type of plant.

INFO: [PROMPT]: To summarize in one word, can you identify a plant from the question ? Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: no
No specific plant specification was given. I'll just answer your question then.

INFO: [PROMPT]: It is now time to answer the question itself. The question was Why do leaves fall in autumn ?. Answer it.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: I'd be delighted to!

Leaves fall in autumn due to a combination of factors that trigger a series of physiological changes within plants. Here's a breakdown of the main reasons:

1. **Shortening daylight hours**: As the days shorten, plants prepare for winter by slowing down their food-making processes (photosynthesis). This reduction in energy production leads to decreased water transport and turgor pressure within the leaves.
[BLABLA]
4. **Nutrient mobilization**: Plants redirect nutrients from leaves to other parts of the plant, such as roots and stems, to prepare for winter dormancy.

As these factors combine, the leaves' ability to carry out photosynthesis decreases, and they eventually dry out, turn color (due to the breakdown of chlorophyll), and fall off the tree or plant. This process is a natural adaptation that allows plants to:

* Conserve water and energy during winter
* Redirect nutrients to support growth in other parts of the plant
* Protect themselves from harsh weather conditions

So, there you have it! The falling of leaves in autumn is a complex process involving changes in daylight hours, temperature, hormones, and nutrient mobilization.
I'd be delighted to!

					<p>▶️ Outputs :</p>
					<pre><code class="text-output">INFO: [PROMPT]: Is the following question about plants ? <question>Why do poppies fade so quickly ?</question>
Explain your reasoning.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: A lovely question!

Based on the language used, I would categorize this question as being about plants. Here's why:

1. The question mentions a specific type of plant: "poppies". This suggests that the inquiry is related to botany.
2. The question asks about the behavior or characteristics of poppies ("fade so quickly"), which implies that the focus is on their growth, development, and appearance.

Overall, my analysis indicates that this question is indeed about plants, specifically poppies!

INFO: [PROMPT]: To summarize in one word, was the question about plants ? Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: Yes
Question is about plants !

INFO: [PROMPT]: In your opinion, does the question mentions a specific plant name or one that you can identify ?

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: I'd say that the question does mention a specific plant name: "poppies". Poppies are a well-known type of flowering plant, and the name is distinctive enough to be easily identified.

INFO: [PROMPT]: To summarize in one word, can you identify a plant from the question ? Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: Yes

INFO: [PROMPT]: Okay, then extract the plant name and ONLY output the name. Nothing else.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: Poppies

INFO: [PROMPT]: What do you know about the plant Poppies ? Get me the scientific name but stay concise.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: Poppies belong to the family Papaveraceae. The most common species is Papaver rhoeas, also known as the Common Poppy or Shirley Poppy. It's an annual flowering plant native to Europe and Asia.
------ Plant info ------
You are referring to the plant 'Poppies'. Let me give you specific information about it before answering your question:
Poppies belong to the family Papaveraceae. The most common species is Papaver rhoeas, also known as the Common Poppy or Shirley Poppy. It's an annual flowering plant native to Europe and Asia.
------------------------

INFO: [PROMPT]: It is now time to answer the question itself. The question was Why do poppies fade so quickly ?. Answer it.

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: Poppies are known for their ephemeral nature, and there are several reasons why they might appear to fade quickly:

1. **Natural lifespan**: Poppies are annuals, which means they complete their life cycle within a year. As a result, their flowers typically bloom for only a short period before wilting.
[BLABLA]
5. **Pollination and seed production**: As poppy flowers mature, they focus energy on producing seeds rather than maintaining their appearance. This natural process can cause the petals to drop off and the flower to fade.

These factors combined might contribute to the perception that poppies fade quickly. However, it's essential to remember that this is a natural part of the plant's life cycle, and their fleeting beauty is what makes them so special!

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: No, the question "Why is the sky blue?" is not about plants. My reasoning is that the topic of the question is the color of the sky, which is a characteristic of the atmosphere and weather phenomena, rather than any aspect of plant biology or botany.
