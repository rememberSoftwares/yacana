					<p>Yacana provides a way to make more than two agents speak one after the other. Better yet, there
						is no limit to the number of agents that you can add. However, note that the dual conversation
						pattern should be the one giving the best results as LLM were trained to speak to one user. Not
						be part of a multi-user conversation… <br />
						Still, the functionality is here for you to use! <br />
						To make this happen Yacana makes the Agents enter a role-play situation. It will heavily rely on
						the agent's name, so be sure that each of them has a concise, yet meaningful, name/title. </p>
					<p>Let's play another dumb game where 3 players must output one letter each. The game is won when
						the fourth player (the game master) can make a valid 4-letter word from the previously outputted
						letters. </p>

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE][From: Game master]: [Game master]: After analyzing the letters provided so far (T-E-H), I can see that they don't form a valid 4-letter word. The game continues!

INFO: [PROMPT][To: Game master]: [TaskManager]: In your opinion, what objectives from your initial task have you NOT completed ?

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE][From: Game master]: [Game master]: As the Game master, my only objective was to check if the word created by the other players is composed of 4 letters. Since I've checked and it's not a valid 4-letter word yet, my objective remains incomplete.

INFO: [PROMPT][To: Game master]: To summarize in one word, did you still had some objectives to fulfill ? Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'. Do not output anything else !

INFO: [PROMPT][To: Game master]: [TaskManager]: In your opinion, what objectives from your initial task have you NOT completed ?

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE][From: Game master]: [Game master]: Upon reviewing my original task, I realize that I was supposed to check if the word created by the other players is composed of 4 letters. However, since the game has been completed and a valid 4-letter word "HALE" has been formed, I can say that this objective has indeed been met. Therefore, in my opinion, I have NOT left any objectives from my initial task uncompleted.

INFO: [PROMPT][To: Game master]: To summarize in one word, did you still had some objectives to fulfill ? Answer ONLY by 'yes' or 'no'. Do not output anything else !

INFO: [AI_RESPONSE][From: Game master]: no

					<p>During the first round the proposed letters are "T - E - H".<br>
						The game master responds to this with:
						<code>After analyzing the letters provided so far (T-E-H), I can see that they don't form a valid 4-letter word. The game continues!</code>
						<br />
						During the second round new letters are added: "A - L - S".<br>
						To which the game master responds:
						<code>After analyzing the letters provided so far (T-E-H-A-L-S), I can see that they form a valid 4-letter word: HALE! Congratulations, the game is complete!</code>.
						After which the chat ends!
					</p>
					<p class="icon solid fa-info-circle"> Note that all types of ["end chat" modes]() @todo url are

					<h4>Pros and cons of multi-LLM group chat</h4>
					<p><strong>Dual chat</strong> <br />
						Pros: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>The dual group chat may have better accuracy with "dumb" LLMs assuming that you don't use
							tools as this may plumber the model's limited reasoning skills.</li>
						<li>Many options to configure conversation kick-off (shift message, first message
							reconciliation)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Cons: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Control of the "shift message" and "first message reconciliation" may be a burden for new
							users ;</li>
						<li>Logs readability is not great at the moment ;</li>
					</ul>
					<hr />
					<p><strong>Multi chat (>2)</strong> </p>
					<p>Pros: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Logs readability is good ;</li>
						<li>No "shift message" nor "first message reconciliation" to deal with </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Multi (>2) chat cons: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>LLMs that don't perform well with role-play may experience difficulties like impersonation ;
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="icon solid fa-info-circle"> We might consider adding an option to also use role-play for
						dual chat mode.</p>
