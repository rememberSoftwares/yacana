					<p>Now that you have an Ollama server running and Yacana installed let's create our first agent!</p>
					<p>Create a Python file with this content:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> yacana <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Agent

						agent1 = Agent(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;AI assistant&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;llama3:8b&quot;</span>, system_prompt=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;You are a helpful AI assistant&quot;</span>, endpoint=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;http://127.0.0.1:11434&quot;</span>)
						</code></pre>
					<p>The Agent(...) class takes 2 mandatory parameters:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>The agent name</strong>: Choose something short about the agent's global focus</li>
						<li><strong>A model name</strong>: The Ollama model that this Agent will use. You may have
							multiple Agents running different models. Some models are better suited for some specific
							jobs so it can be interesting to mix LLM models. Use <code>ollama list</code> to list the
							models you have downloaded.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The Agent(...) class has many optional parameters that we will discover in this tutorial. Here we
						can see 2 of them:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>The system prompt</strong>: Helps define the personality of the Agent.</li>
						<li><strong>The endpoint</strong>: The URL of your Ollama instance. It points by default to your
							localhost and on the Ollama default port. If you are using Ollama on your computer you can
							remove this optional parameter and the default value will be used.</li>
					</ol>
					<h2 id="basic-roleplay">Basic roleplay</h2>
					<p>This framework is not meant for basic roleplay. However, for people starting their journey in the
						realm of AI and for debugging purposes, we added a simple chat system. Add this new line to test
						it :</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python">agent1.simple_chat()
							</code></pre>
					<p>When running this python file you should enter a chat with the LLM. The Agent keeps track of the
						history so that it can answer using past information.</p>
					<pre><code class="language-shell"><span class="hljs-meta prompt_">$ </span><span class="language-bash">python3 simple_chat_demo.py</span>
							</code></pre>
					<p>Output:</p>
					<pre><code>Type 'quit' then enter to exit.
							&gt; hey
							Hey! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with, or would you like to chat about something in particular? I'm here to assist you with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss.
							&gt;
							</code></pre>
					<p>Let's change the <strong>system prompt</strong> and have some fun!</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python">agent1 = Agent(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Pirate&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;llama3:8b&quot;</span>, system_prompt=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;You are a pirate&quot;</span>, endpoint=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;http://127.0.0.1:11434&quot;</span>)
							</code></pre>
					<p>Output:</p>
					<pre><code>Type 'quit' then enter to exit.
							&gt; hey
							Arrrr, shiver me timbers! What be bringin' ye to these fair waters? Are ye lookin' fer a swashbucklin' adventure or just passin' through?
							&gt; Searching for the tresor of red beard any idea where it's hidden ?
							Red Beard's treasure, ye say? (puffs on pipe) Well, I be knowin' a thing or two about that scurvy dog and his loot. But, I'll only be tellin' ye if ye be willin' to share yer own booty... of information! (winks)
							</code></pre>
					<hr>
					<p>Complete section code:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> yacana <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Agent
							
							agent1 = Agent(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Pirate&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;llama3:8b&quot;</span>, system_prompt=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;You are a pirate&quot;</span>, endpoint=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;http://127.0.0.1:11434&quot;</span>)
							agent1.simple_chat()
							</code></pre>
					<p>⚠️From now on we will not set the <em>endpoint</em> attribute anymore for clarity and will resort
						to the defaults. If your LLM is not served by Ollama or isn't on your localhost you should
						continue setting this value.</p>
					<h2 id="creating-tasks">Creating Tasks</h2>
					<p>The whole concept of the framework lies here. If you understand this following section then you
						have mastered 80% of Yacana's building principle. Like in LangGraph, where you create nodes that
						you link together, Yacana has a Task() class which takes as arguments a task to solve. There are
						no hardcoded links between the Tasks so it's easy to refactor and move things around. The
						important concept to grasp here is that through these Tasks you will give instructions to the
						LLM in a way that the result must be computable. meaning instructions must be clear and the
						prompt to use must reflect that. It's a Task, it's a job, it's something that needs solving but
						written like it is given as an order! Let's see some examples :</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> yacana <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Agent, Task
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># First, let&#x27;s make a basic AI agent</span>
							agent1 = Agent(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;AI assistant&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;llama3:8b&quot;</span>, system_prompt=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;You are a helpful AI assistant&quot;</span>)
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># Now we create a task and assign the agent1 to the task</span>
							task1 = Task(<span class="hljs-string">f&quot;Solve the equation 2 + 2 and output the result&quot;</span>, agent1)
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># For something to happen, you must call the .solve() method on your task.</span>
							task1.solve()
							</code></pre>
					<p>What's happening above?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>First, we instantiated an Agent with the <code>llama3:8b</code> model. You might need to
							update that depending on what LLM you downloaded from Ollama ;</li>
						<li>Second, we instantiated a Task ;</li>
						<li>Third, we asked that the Task be solved ;</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="icon solid fa-info-circle">For easing the learning curve the default logging level is
						INFO. It will show what is going on in Yacana. Note that not ALL prompts are shown.</p>
					<p>The output should look like this:</p>
					<pre><code>INFO: [PROMPT]: Solve the equation 2 + 2 and output the result
							
							INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: The answer to the equation 2 + 2 is... (drumroll please)... 4!
							
							So, the result of solving the equation 2 + 2 is indeed 4.
							</code></pre>
					<p>If your terminal is working normally you should see the task's prompts in green and starting with
						the '[PROMPT]' string. The LLM's answer should appear purple and start with the [AI_RESPONSE]
						string.</p>
					<h4 id="task-parameters">Task parameters</h4>
					<p>The Task class takes 2 mandatory parameters:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The prompt: It is the task to be solved. Use imperative language, be precise, and ask for
							step-by-step thinking for complex Tasks and expected outputs if needed.</li>
						<li>The Agent: The agent that will be assigned to this task. The agent will be in charge of
							solving the task.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="icon solid fa-info-circle">Many other parameters can be given to a Task. We will see some
						of them in the following sections of this tutorial. But you can already check out the Task class
						documentation @todo URL</p>
					<h4 id="in-what-way-is-this-disruptive-compared-to-other-frameworks">In what way is this disruptive
						compared to other frameworks?</h4>
					<p>In the above code snippet, we assigned the agent to the Task. So it's the Task that leads the
						direction that the AI takes. In most other frameworks it's the opposite. You assign work to an
						existing agent. This reversed way allows to have fined grained control on each resolution step
						as the LLM only follows bread crumb (the tasks). The pattern will become even more obvious as we
						get to the Tool section of this tutorial. As you'll see the Tools are also assigned at the Task
						level and not to the Agent directly.</p>
					<p>To compare with LangGraph, we indeed cannot generate a call graph as an image because we don't
						bind the tasks together explicitly. However, Yacana's way gives more flexibility and allows a
						hierarchical programming way of scheduling the tasks and keeping control of the flow. It also
						allows creating new Task dynamically if the need arises. You shall rely on your programming
						skills and good OOP to have a clean code and good Task ordering. There aren't and will never be
						any pre-hardcoded interactions and no flat config. This is a framework for developers.</p>
					<h2 id="getting-the-result-of-a-task">Getting the result of a Task</h2>
					<p>Even though we get logs on the standard output of the terminal, we still need to extract the
						answer of the LLM that solved that Task in order to do something with it.<br>
						Getting the string message out of it is quite easy as the .solve() method returns a Message()
						@todo URL class.<br>
						Maybe you are thinking &quot;Ho nooo, another class to deal with&quot;. Well, let me tell you
						that it's always better to have an OOP class than some semi-random Python dictionary where
						you'll forget what keys it contains in ten minutes. Also, the Message @todo url class is very
						straightforward. It exposes a <code>content</code> attribute. Update the current code to look
						like this:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> yacana <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Agent, Task, Message
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># First, let&#x27;s make a basic AI agent</span>
							agent1 = Agent(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;AI assistant&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;llama3:8b&quot;</span>, system_prompt=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;You are a helpful AI assistant&quot;</span>)
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># Now we create a task and assign the agent1 to the task</span>
							task1 = Task(<span class="hljs-string">f&quot;Solve the equation 2 + 2 and output the result&quot;</span>, agent1)
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># So that something actually happens you must call the .solve() method on your task</span>
							my_message: Message = task1.solve()
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># Printing the LLM&#x27;s response</span>
							<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f&quot;The AI response to our task is : <span class="hljs-subst">{my_message.content}</span>&quot;</span>)
							</code></pre>
					<p>There you go! Give it a try.</p>
					<p class="icon solid fa-info-circle"> Note that we used duck typing to postfix all variables
						declaration with their type <code>my_message: Message</code>. Yacana's source code is entirely
						duck-typed so that your IDE always knows what type it's dealing with and proposes the best
						methods and arguments. We recommend that you do the same as it's the industry's best standards.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>Don't like having 100 lines of code for something simple? Then chain them all in one line!</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> yacana <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Agent, Task
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># First, let&#x27;s make a basic AI agent</span>
							agent1 = Agent(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;AI assistant&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;llama3:8b&quot;</span>, system_prompt=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;You are a helpful AI assistant&quot;</span>)
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># Now we create a task and assign the agent1 to the task</span>
							task1 = Task(<span class="hljs-string">f&quot;Solve the equation 2 + 2 and output the result&quot;</span>, agent1)
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># Creating the task, solving it, extracting the result and printing it all in one line</span>
							<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f&quot;The AI response to our task is: <span class="hljs-subst">{Task(<span class="hljs-string">f&#x27;Solve the equation 2 + 2 and output the result&#x27;</span>, agent1).solve().content}</span>&quot;</span>)
							</code></pre>
					<p>🤔 However, splitting the output of the LLM and the print in two lines would probably look
						better. Let's not one-line things too much 😅.</p>
					<h2 id="chaining-tasks">Chaining Tasks</h2>
					<p>Chaining Tasks is nothing more than just calling a second Task with the same Agent. Agents keep
						track of the History of what they did (aka, all the Tasks they solved). So just call a second
						Task and assign the same Agent. For instance, let's multiply by 2 the result of the initial
						Task. Append this to our current script:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python">task2_result: <span class="hljs-built_in">str</span> = Task(<span class="hljs-string">f&#x27;Multiply by 2 our previous result&#x27;</span>, agent1).solve().content
							<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f&quot;The AI response to our second task is : <span class="hljs-subst">{task2_result}</span>&quot;</span>)
							</code></pre>
					<p>You should get:</p>
					<pre><code>The AI response to our task is: If we multiply the previous result of 4 by 2, we get:
							
							8
							</code></pre>
					<p class="icon solid fa-info-circle"> Without tools this only relies on the LLM's ability to do the
						maths and is dependent on its training.</p>
					<hr>
					<p>See? The assigned Agent remembered that it had solved the Task1 previously and used this
						information to solve the second task.<br>
						You can chain as many Tasks as you need. Also, you should create other Agents that don't have
						the knowledge of previous tasks and make them do things based on the output of your first agent.
						You can build anything now!</p>
					<h2 id="logging-levels">Logging levels</h2>
					<p>As entering the AI landscape can get a bit hairy we decided to leave the INFO log level by
						default. This allows to log to the standard output all the requests made to the LLM.<br>
						Note that NOT everything of Yacana's internal magic appears in these logs. We don't show
						everything because many time-traveling things are going around the history of an Agent and
						printing a log at the time it is generated wouldn't always make sense.<br>
						However, we try to log a maximum of information to help you understand what is happening
						internally and allow you to tweak your prompts accordingly.</p>
					<p>Nonetheless, you are the master of what is logged and what isn't. You cannot let Yacana logs
						activated when working with an app in production.<br>
						There are 5 levels of logs:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>&quot;DEBUG&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;INFO&quot; &lt;= Default</li>
						<li>&quot;WARNING&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;ERROR&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;CRITICAL&quot;</li>
						<li>None &lt;= No logs</li>
					</ol>
					<p>To configure the log simply add this line at the start of your program:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> yacana <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> LoggerManager
							
							LoggerManager.set_log_level(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;INFO&quot;</span>)
							</code></pre>
					<p class="icon solid fa-info-circle">Note that Yacana utilizes the Python logging package. This
						means that setting the level to &quot;DEBUG&quot; will print other libraries' logs on the debug
						level too.</p>
					<p>If you need a library to stop spamming, you can try the following:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> yacana <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> LoggerManager
							
							LoggerManager.set_library_log_level(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;httpx&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;WARNING&quot;</span>)
							</code></pre>
					<p>The above example sets the logging level of the network httpx library to warning, thus reducing
						the log spamming.</p>
					<h2 id="configuring-llms-settings">Configuring LLM's settings</h2>
					<p>For advanced users, Yacana provides a way to tweak the LLM runtime behavior!<br>
						For instance, lowering the <code>temperature</code> setting makes the model less creative in its
						responses. On the contrary, raising this setting will make the LLM more chatty and creative.<br>
						Yacana provides you with a class that exposes all the possible LLM properties. Look at them <a
							href="">here</a> @todo url and if you need a good explanation of each of them I would
						recommend the <a href="https://youtu.be/QfFRNF5AhME?si=lpSYUq2WoidYiqzP">excellent video</a>
						Matt Williams did on this subject.</p>
					<p class="icon solid fa-info-circle"> These settings are set at the Agent level so that you can have
						the same model used by two separate agents and have them behave differently.</p>
					<p>We use the <a href="">ModelSettings</a> @todo url class to configure the settings we need.</p>
					<p>For example, let's lower the temperature of an Agent to 0.4:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> yacana <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> ModelSettings, Agent
							
							ms = ModelSettings(temperature=<span class="hljs-number">0.4</span>)
							
							agent1 = Agent(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Ai assistant&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;llama3:8b&quot;</span>, model_settings=ms)
							</code></pre>
					<p>If you're wondering what are the default values of these when not set. Well, Ollama sets the
						default for you. They can also be overridden in the Model config file (looks like a dockerfile
						but for LLMs) and finally, you can set them through Yacana during runtime.</p>
					<p>A good way to show how this can have a real impact on the output is by setting the
						<code>num_predict</code> parameter. This one allows control of how many tokens should be
						generated by the LLM. Let's make the same Task twice but with different <code>num_predict</code>
						values:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> yacana <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> ModelSettings, Agent, Task
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># Setting temperature and max token to 100</span>
							ms = ModelSettings(temperature=<span class="hljs-number">0.4</span>, num_predict=<span class="hljs-number">100</span>)
							
							agent1 = Agent(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Ai assistant&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;llama3:8b&quot;</span>, model_settings=ms)
							Task(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Why is the sky blue ?&quot;</span>, agent1).solve()
							
							<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;-------------------&quot;</span>)
							
							<span class="hljs-comment"># Settings max token to 15</span>
							ms = ModelSettings(num_predict=<span class="hljs-number">15</span>)
							
							agent2 = Agent(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Ai assistant&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;llama3:8b&quot;</span>, model_settings=ms)
							Task(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Why is the sky blue ?&quot;</span>, agent2).solve()
							</code></pre>
					<p>Output:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-python">INFO: [PROMPT]: Why <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> the sky blue ?
							
							INFO: [AI_RESPONSE]: The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. Here<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;s what happens:
							
							1. **Sunlight**: When sunlight enters Earth&#x27;</span>s atmosphere, it contains <span class="hljs-built_in">all</span> the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> violet).
							<span class="hljs-number">2.</span> **Molecules**: The atmosphere <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> made up of tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than

							INFO: [PROMPT]: Why <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> the sky blue ?

					<p>As you can see above the two agents didn't output the same number of tokens.</p>
