# Yacana
Task driven LLM multi-agents framework that gives you the building blocks to create AI workflows for local LLMs.

## Functionnalities
* Built for getting the best results with local opensource LLMs ;  
* Multi Agent workflows ;  
* Tool calling for all models, even dumb ones ;
* Multi turn chat between Agents

## Why choose Yacana over other frameworks ?

Yacana was built to make local LLMs great ! It won't work with chatGPT and we don't intend to make it.  
Currently the best AI frameworks in their category are CrewAI and LangGraph.  
* CrewAI is very simple to use but is terrible when dealing with local models. This is because most of the heavy lifting is left to the LLM and if chatGPT or any other proprietary frontier models can deal with complexe prompting, local LLMs cannot. Can we really expect to have the same performance from 8 Billion parameters model than proprietary model that have over 1000 Bilion parameters ? it's impossible. That's why CrewAI doesn't do well with local LLMs and also. This means that it cannot call tools ! And calling tool is the most useful funtionnality a framework should offer.
*So why Yacana ?*
