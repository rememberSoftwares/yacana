Yacana is designed for both beginners and advanced AI users.  
It features a simple OOP API with a smooth learning curve, while also offering advanced runtime LLM configurations when needed.  
The real strength of the framework lies in its ability to deliver impressive results with open-source models, even small ones, making tool calling effortless with any LLM.  
For production-grade capabilities, Yacana offers a guided workflow approach or multi-turn chat, both leveraging what we typically call 'Agents.' However, Yacana takes a different approach to Agents compared to other frameworks, focusing more on chaining Tasks together rather than on the Agents themselves.
