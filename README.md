## What it is

Yacana is designed for both *beginners* and *advanced* AI users.  

It features a simple OOP API with a **smooth learning curve**, while also offering advanced runtime LLM configurations when needed.  

The real strength of the framework lies in its ability to deliver impressive results with open-source models, even small ones, making **tool calling effortless with any LLM**.  

For production-grade capabilities, Yacana offers a **guided workflow** approach or **multi-turn chat**, both leveraging what we typically call 'Agents*'. However, Yacana takes a different approach to Agents compared to other frameworks, focusing more on chaining Tasks together rather than on the Agents themselves.
